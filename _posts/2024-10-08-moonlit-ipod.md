# moonlit.market classic connect review

Recently I bought the moonlit.market mod kit for the iPod classics. I have a lot of great things to say, and sum minor dislikes...

For starters this mod is a complete backshell replacement for your iPod. It includes a USB-C mod, bluetooth support, and has solder pads for allowing you to transfer through USB-C, and some other crazy cool features.

So lets go over what I liked:

I was very surpised by how good the print quality on the shell was. I'm probably wrong but I thought the shell was 3d printed. It's very smooth and works as a pretty good replacement even too the metal chassy of the original.

I haven't had any problems with the bluetooth although initially figuring it out was confusing. Basically you click it once to turn on the bluetooth or connect it (although it will usually automatically connect) and then when you want to add a new device just double click the bluetooth button. 

I was able to get the ImCort micro SD card reader working, which is a great, super small little micro SD card reader. I do have a problem with that but I've seen some fixes I'll talk about later.

The whole build of it feels pretty much sturdy but I do have a few little problems with the mounting of it though. Overall though it works just as I hoped.

Okay so some of my problems with it start with how it's kept in its case:

The way you mount the frontplate and components to the custom case is by gluing it. This, I feel, is really the downfall of this mod because while it's super good in a lot of areas the gluing part just never allows it to fully feel sturdy. It's not a dealbreaker though.

I did have a problem with my SD card, or my audio files. Basically I restored my iPod after transfering my library from my hard drive and pretty recently I've noticed some static and skipping on lots of my tracks. Half of me beleives this is just the fact that I converted all my flacs to ALAC (dont do this ðŸ’€) but they play fine on my computer and I just can't really tell. If I had to guess I would say that I probably need to reformat the SD card or use a different one as this one may be corrupted but I'll update yall if I find out anything.
**\_ UPDATE: This seems to be a card issue, my other card is working perfectly fine. The ImCort SD card reader rocks!**

This mod is a great one for people who don't know how to solder and I think if you want a bluetooth and usb-c kit then this is your mod. If you just care about bluetooth and want that original stock metal case there is another mod from [partpluspods](https://partspluspods.com.au/product/bluetooth-upgrade-kit-for-apple-ipod-classic-5th-gen/) although I havne't tried that so I can't tell you wether it's good or not. I'm planning on trying it with my 5th gen as I would die for that 5th gen dac to get bluetooth but yeah. I hope you enjoyed my little review!

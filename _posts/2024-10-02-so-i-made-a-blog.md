# i made a blog

i know blogs aren't really popular anymore but i wanted a place to share projects and more that i was too lazy to put on youtube. hopfully jekyll doesn't crap itself and it works out but yeah. ill just post projects and other stuff here mianly to showcase whatever i'm doing.

## a cool project i'm working on rn

so since i'm a little bored from school but still too lazy to make a damn youtube video (lol) i've been working on a upgrade for my ipod and its looking pretty good! i'm using a elite obsolete electronics ipod shell with the moonlit market bluetooth and classic connect mod. i also used their storage mod so we'll see how that goes. overall i'm very excited to see how this turns out. at the moment i just need to tape it up. i'll make another post when i get it working.
